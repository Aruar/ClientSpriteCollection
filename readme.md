# Welcome to a Official Sprite Collection
This repository is only used to make searching for official items easier from certain servers.

Used in this project are only items so far, but might change in the future what else I should upload here.
Also the decoded original files (lua files, System folder, etc), like I had in the [Translation Project](https://github.com/llchrisll/ROenglishRE),
can be found in the respective server folder under ```decoded```.
